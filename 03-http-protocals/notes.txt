1) stateless

2) client - server
    http assumes that client always makes the request 
    https is just a more secured version of http built on top of http
    to send req or res from client or server some sort of connection is needed 
    http uses tcp / udp , tcp -> more reliable 

    refer osi model here and application layer in particular
