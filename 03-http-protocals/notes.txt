1) stateless

2) client - server
    http assumes that client always makes the request 
    https is just a more secured version of http built on top of http
    to send req or res from client or server some sort of connection is needed 
    http uses tcp / udp , tcp -> more reliable 

    refer osi model here and application layer in particular


    some complex request message 

    PUT /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
    host : example.com
    user-agent : chrome
    content-type : application/json
    content-length : 123
    authorization : bearer asdf.asdfad;fksadf;lk.asdflasdjfl
    accept : application/json
    accept-encoding : gzip , deflate , bearer
    connection : keep-alive
    referer : https://example.com/dashboard
    cookie:sessionId=asdf234asdw34;
    lang=en-user

    {
        "firstName" : "John",
        "lastName" : "Doe",
        "email" : "john.doe@example.com",
        "age":30
    }


    some complex response message

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date : 
    content-type : application/json
    content-lenght : 123
    connection : keep-alive
    server : server name here

    // add all the response headers here 

    representation headers 
    content-type 
    content-lenght
    content-encoding
    etag

    security headers 
    strict-transport-security (hsts)  -> ensures client communicates over https only
    content-security-polity -> 
    x-frame-options - scripts embedded in ifreame
    x-content-type-options - mime types
    set-cookie - secures cookies


 // some custom headers

    hTTP methods
 -> intent of the interaction 

    get -> get data and donot modify data
    post -> send data to the server
    patch -> update the data
    put -> update data but data compleley replace the previous data
    delete -> resouce data from the server


    idempotenet vs non-idempotenet
    
    idempotenet -> call as many times as possible and still get the same results like get put and delete
    non-idempotent -> // write the destials

    options methods
    cors - same origin policy

    fetch the capability of the server 


    preflighted request
    1) 

 // write code for the same in the express and nodejs for both the option methods and prelifht request


  caching

   // content negotiation add some data here
